# Hackerrank
This repository contains my submissions to HackerRank.  I started solving problems on Hacker Rank as a way to get into Functional Programming so most solutions you will find here are written in Python-3.  Chapters are ordered in folders I usually browse the leaderboard after having solved a new challenge. Happy reading, and solve your own challenges first before peaking here ;)
